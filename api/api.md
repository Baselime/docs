# Baselime API

The Baselime CLI allows you to interact with your observability configurations and telemetry data through an HTTP API.

All requests should be sent via HTTPS to `go.baselime.io` with an [API key](../advanced/auth-keys.md) in the `Authorization` header.

All request payloads should be sent as JSON.
