# Observability as Code Reference

This is the documentation for Baselime's Observability as Code configuration file. It is relevant to [Baselime CLI](../cli/overview.md) and web console users. The Baselime observability as code configurations are defined in a [YAML](https://yaml.org/) file. This file tells Baselime which plugins to install, which resources to create, edit or delete, or what data to fetch.

Generally, the Baselime Observability as Code configuration will be a `.baselime.yml` file in the root directory of a given project. We refer to this file as the `.baselime.yml` elsewhere in the documentation, although users can rename it at will.

Multiple integrations and connectors with your favourite Infrastructure as Code platforms are currently being developed.
