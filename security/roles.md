# Roles and Permissions

---

Baselime empowers **software engineering teams** to gain a deeper understanding of their serverless infrastructure. Team members can collaborate on Baselime, share knowledge and break down silos. We achieve this with the help of user roles.

There are 4 types of user roles in Baselime workspaces, with different permissions.

+++ Owner
Workspace owners control billing and all destructive actions on the workspace.

Each workspace can have a single owner, typically the person who created the workspace.

Workspace owner permissions can be transferred.


+++ Admin
Workspace admins control billing and all destructive actions on items within the workspace, but cannot delete the workspace itself.

It's possible to have multiple workspace admins within a workspace.
+++ Collaborator
Collaborators are the default role.

They can perform all actions on Baselime, with the exception of destructive actions on private items of other users.
+++ Guest
Guests have read-only access to data within Baselime.
